## Predicting Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) with Machine Learning
# 🔬 Introduction
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder affecting millions of women worldwide. It can lead to infertility, diabetes, heart disease, and other complications. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective management and treatment.

This project leverages machine learning to predict PCOS using patient data, aiding healthcare professionals in efficient diagnosis and early intervention.

# 🩺 Why This Project Matters?
✔ Early Detection: Helps in early identification of PCOS to prevent long-term health complications.
✔ AI-Powered Decision Support: Assists gynecologists and endocrinologists in diagnosing PCOS more accurately.
✔ Data-Driven Healthcare: Enables hospitals and clinics to integrate predictive analytics for better patient care.

# 📊 Dataset
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, containing 120,000+ records from women aged 15-49 years across 75 countries. The dataset includes factors such as:
Menstrual cycle irregularities
Hormonal imbalances
Lifestyle factors
Medical history

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Techniques Used
🔹 Decision Trees – Simple yet effective in identifying key PCOS indicators
🔹 Neural Networks – For complex pattern recognition and feature learning
🔹 Support Vector Machines (SVMs) – To classify PCOS cases with high precision
🔹 Logistic Regression – To estimate probability of PCOS occurrence

## 📈 Model Performance
✔ 90% Accuracy – Reliable predictions for PCOS detection
✔ High Precision & Recall – Effective in identifying true PCOS cases
✔ Balanced F1 Score – Ensuring overall performance consistency

## 🛠 Tech Stack
